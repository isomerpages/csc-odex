<p><strong>Kopi Jio</strong> is a conversation deck meticulously crafted by
our team of learning designers from the Institute of Leadership and Organisation
Development&nbsp;as the result of a sandbox experiment that was initiated
in September 2023 to address the growing need for innovative ways to enhance
well-being within the Public Service. Our primary goal in creating Kopi
Jio was to empower teams by promoting effective communication, developing
micro-skills, and fostering reflexivity in a way that seamlessly integrates
into our daily work. The concept originated from envisioning our team engaging
in these crucial conversations over a cup of local coffee, hence the name
"Kopi Jio".</p>
<p>There are many ways to use the deck - it can be incorporated into regular
team meetings to facilitate open and constructive dialogue or integrated
into team-building or leadership development workshops. The prompts are
categorised into three levels of intensity, tailored to the perceived level
of psychological safety required to answer the questions. For instance,
new teams may opt to commence with level 1 cards and progress to level
3 over time and we have also successfully adapted them for use in our institute
meeting! The conversational prompts in Kopi Jio are designed to spark meaningful
discussions, encourage active listening, and strengthen interpersonal connections
among team members.</p>
<p>Grab a cup of <em>Kopi</em> and <em>Jio</em> your team mates and begin having
meaningful conversations together!</p>
