<h3>About ODEx</h3>
<p>Organisation Development is an extraordinary function not only because
the work spans between functions and across organisational systems but
also because the work of an OD practitioner is nothing short of being extraordinarily
complex and challenging.</p>
<p>CSC-ILOD is dedicated to the capability development of OD practitioners,
so that <strong>Agency organisations have the internal capacity to address and adapt to continual challenges</strong>,
and <strong>OD practitioners have the ability to support their leaders in building future-fit, healthy and sustainable organisations.</strong>
</p>
<p>We want to support practitioners who undertake the OD journey (<strong><em>ode</em></strong>)
to make extraordinary (<strong><em>x</em></strong>) impact to the organisations
they are a part of and who want to be a part of a vibrant community that
is committed to making their organisations a better place.</p>
