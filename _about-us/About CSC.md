The Civil Service College Singapore has been redefining learning in the Public Service since 2001. 

We are a future-oriented Centre of Learning committed to nurturing a learning mindset and culture in the Singapore Public Service. As the central learning institution for the Singapore Public Service, we take pride in leading the practice of learning design, leadership development and organisation development. We provide timely, relevant and innovative programmes and services that build strategic capacity in governance, leadership, public administration and management for the Singapore Public Service. 

By partnering with government agencies, we are able to offer opportunities to network and exchange views, build shared ethos and perspectives, in a rich and safe environment for dialogues, knowledge-sharing and learning.
