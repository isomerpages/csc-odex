<tr><td><h5><b>What are the respective roles of Human Resource, Organisation Development and Strategic Planning in Organisation Design? </b> </h5><br>
To do well in organisation design, HR, OD and SP functions need to work together closely as they each bring in a different lense and input which contribute to the larger whole system for the organisation.<br><br><a href ="http://vimeo.com/258724830" target="_blank"><b>WATCH NOW</b></a></td> <td><img src="/images/teamarrow.jpg"></td></tr>

<tr><td><h5><b>Where should the Organisation Design practitioner and the Organisation Design work be best situated in a Public Service agency to maximise effectiveness?</b> </h5><br>
Typically, organisation design or organisation development sits in a HR function, but Dr Naomi Stanford recommends for it to better sit in the Strategy or Operations Planning functions. Key reasons are the "business vs people" narrative attributed by where it sits, and the more effective development and delivery of business strategies for the organisation.<br><br><a href ="https://vimeo.com/363214635/bf8847eb28" target="_blank"><b>WATCH NOW</b></a></td> <td><img src="/images/team6.jpg"></td></tr>
	
<tr><td><h5><b>Who do we involve in the organisation design process?</b> </h5><br>

<tr><td><h5><b>What differentiates between Organisation Design, Organisation Development and Change Management? </b> </h5><br>
Organisation design, Organisation development and Change management are 3 different disciplines but there are areas of intersections for us to be aware of. In practice, we need to adopt a range of tools and approaches across the 3 disciplines, and apply the appropriate one for the challenge/opportunity we are intervening on. <br><br><a href ="https://vimeo.com/363214689/a1c3eaf3bd" target="_blank"><b>WATCH NOW</b></a></td> <td><img src="/images/self2.jpg"></td></tr>
